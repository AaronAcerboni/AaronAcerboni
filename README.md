### About me

I mainly program in JavaScript.

Two projects I am particularly proud of are:

- [connect-ratelimit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-ratelimit) - which is [connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect) middleware 
for limiting IPs which can connect to a configurable amount. It still proves popular with 520 weekly downloads as of September 2021!
- [noodle](https://github.com/dharmafly/noodle) - which is an npm module and stand-alone [connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect) 
server for web scraping various web documents including JSON, HTML et cetera. It's fairly popular and I think underrated at 60 weekly 
downloads as of September 2021.

- üåê  [AaronAcerboni.xyz/blog](http://aaronacerboni.xyz/blog) is my personal website. I sometimes blog on lifting weights.
